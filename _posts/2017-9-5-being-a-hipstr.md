title: "Being a HipstR: the coolest R packages you've never heard of"
---

On Monday September 4th I presented at the [Oxford R user group](https://r-oxford.github.io/) on some R packages I found very useful during my PhD but which people might not have otherwise heard of. The slides for this talk along with links to the packages can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/files/being-a-hipstr.html).
